He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.[31] Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade.[32] In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties.[33] He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died in 1900.[34]\\n\" +\r\n            \"\\n\" +\r\n            \"Nietzsche's writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony.[35] Prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality and related theory of master–slave morality;[27][36][i] aesthetic affirmation of existence in response to the \\\"death of God\\\" and the profound crisis of nihilism;[27] notion of the Apollonian and Dionysian; and characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power.[37] He also developed influential concepts such as the Übermensch and the doctrine of eternal return.[38][39] In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health.[30] His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew early inspiration from figures such as philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer,[15] composer Richard Wagner,[15] and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.[15]\\n\" +\r\n            \"\\n\" +\r\n            \"After his death, his sister Elisabeth became the curator and editor of Nietzsche's manuscripts. She edited his unpublished writings to fit her German nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with fascism and Nazism;[40] 20th-century scholars contested this interpretation and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.

His most acclaimed works include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880).

After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money.

Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group that discussed banned books critical of Tsarist Russia, he was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a Siberian prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later A Writer's Diary, a collection of his writings.

It is Dickens's second novel, after David Copperfield, to be fully narrated in the first person.[N 1] The novel was first published as a serial in Dickens's weekly periodical All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861.[1] In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes.[2][3][4]\\n\" +\r\n                    \"\\n\" +\r\n                    \"The novel is set in Kent and London in the early to mid-19th century[5] and contains some of Dickens's most celebrated scenes, starting in a graveyard, where the young Pip is accosted by the escaped convict Abel Magwitch.[6] Great Expectations is full of extreme imagery – poverty, prison ships and chains, and fights to the death[6] – and has a colourful cast of characters who have entered popular culture. These include the eccentric Miss Havisham, the beautiful but cold Estella, and Joe, the unsophisticated and kind blacksmith. Dickens's themes include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.[6] Great Expectations, which is popular both with readers and literary critics,[7][8] has been translated into many languages and adapted numerous times into various media.\\n\" +\r\n                    \"\\n\" +\r\n                    \"Upon its release, the novel received near universal acclaim.[7] Although Dickens's contemporary Thomas Carlyle referred to it disparagingly as that \\\"Pip nonsense,\\\" he nevertheless reacted to each fresh installment with \\\"roars of laughter.\\\"[9] Later, George Bernard Shaw praised the novel, as \\\"All of one piece and consistently truthful.\\\"[10] During the serial publication, Dickens was pleased with public response to Great Expectations and its sales;[11] when the plot first formed in his mind, he called it \\\"a very fine, new and grotesque idea.\\\"[12]\\n\" +\r\n                    \"\\n\" +\r\n                    \"In the 21st century, the novel retains good ratings among literary critics[13] and in 2003 it was ranked 17th on the BBC’s The Big Read poll.[14]\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                image: \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/o2nz0UtsK4hMrffHOLOl8Nbjs95DFcx5F2YpRJcbwCoNz1XscyhtCLWvUGnOalHa9ks8Nh5pQ5r-KxE5wS11OmhhQTlyUbJfRBGdCg6tiPSS8hKp\",\r\n                title: \"David Copperfield\",\r\n                description: \"David Copperfield is the eighth novel by Charles Dickens.

In the preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens wrote, \\\"like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.\\\"[8]\\n\" +\r\n                    \"\\n\" +\r\n                    \"Dickens wrote this novel without an outline, unlike the way he wrote Dombey and Son, the previous novel. He wrote chapter summaries after the chapters were completed. Some aspects of the story were fixed in his mind from the start, but others, like the obsession of Mr Dick with Charles I, the profession of David Copperfield as a writer, and the sad fate of Dora, were not decided by Dickens until the serial publications were underway; August 1849, December 1849 and May 1850, respectively, were the dates when those decisions were made.[9]\\n\" +\r\n                    \"\\n\" +\r\n                    \"At first glance, the work is modeled in the loose and somewhat disjointed way of \\\"personal histories\\\" that was very popular in the United Kingdom of the 18th century;[N 2] but in reality, David Copperfield is a carefully structured and unified novel. It begins, like other novels by Dickens, with a rather bleak painting of the conditions of childhood in Victorian England, notoriously when the troublesome children are parked in infamous boarding schools, then he strives to trace the slow social and intimate ascent of a young man who, painfully providing for the needs of his good aunt while continuing his studies, ends up becoming a writer; the story, writes Paul Davis, of \\\"a Victorian everyman seeking self-understanding\\\".[4]\\n\" +\r\n                    \"\\n\" +\r\n                    \"The novel has a primary theme of growth and the changes that occur on the way to maturity. In addition, Dickens included many aspects of Victorian Era life that he wanted to highlight or wished to change, which were primarily integrated into the story, using satire as one device. The plight of prostitutes and the attitude of middle class society to them, the status of women in marriage, the rigid class structure, are aspects that he highlighted, while the system for handling criminals, the quality of schools, and the employment of children in the fast-spreading factories of the 19th century were aspects he wished to influence, to change for the better. He, among other authors, achieved success in bringing about changes regarding child labour and schooling for more children up to age 12.[10]\"\r\n            },\r\n        ],\r\n    },\r\n]\r\nexport
